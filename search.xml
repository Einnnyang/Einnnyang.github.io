Indeed, this is why I was indulged in philosophy when I was six years old. </p><p>I am currently a student at BSU &amp; PKU NSD.My recent research lies in the intersection of quantum information and econometrics.Luckily,I find it cool and fun to explore complexity science and causal inference.</p><p>I believe that a good theory is simple and effective.And I enjoy working with state-of-the-art data and  powerful but simpler systems to understand tech, life &amp; reality.</p><p>With problem-oriented eyes, My burning curiosity is including but not limited to (1)AI existential safety research (2)the nature of intelligence (3)why some but not all quark blobs are conscious(4)how to better understand inscrutable black-box neural networks.</p><p>A clear, engaging prose style can take us down these exciting pathways of thought without making us lost in nihilism.</p><p>I feel so grateful for all love, wisdom and support from my family and a great inspiration from shinning people around me,always reminding me of how seemingly insurmountable challenges can be overcome with creativity, willpower and positive attitude.</p><p>Wish you an enjoyable trip as self-aware quark blobs at the Omaga star.Here you can share my fascination for both mainstream and controversial science.</p><p>lucky all~</p>]]></content>
